            What's New in 1.3?
        </h2>
        </p>
        <h3>Support for a "centered" mode for mouse move.</h3>
        <p>
            In this mode, rather than nudging the mouse position left/right/up/down, tan analog input can be used to set the absolute location of the mouse as a deviation from the centre of the screen. The further the analog input is from the neutral point, the further away from the centre of the screen the mouse gets placed.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is intended to be a better solution for games such as Elite: Dangerous which can map the mouse to yaw/roll/pitch, and where it's valuable to be able to have the mouse snap back to a central point when the input is released.
        </p>

        <h2>What's New in 1.2?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Automatic switching for applications with ambiguous
                bundle names and executable filenames (e.g. "wine.bin") has
                improved. You can now name a mapping after an application's
                primary window title.
            </li>
            <li>
                Compatibility with OS X 10.9's power-saving features
                (App Nap, etc.) has been improved. Now works at all on
                OS X 10.10.
            </li>
            <li>
                Upgrades no longer occur automatically. This is due
                to privacy concerns and Apple repeatedly breaking
                their code signing infrastructure.
            </li>
